        <p>I have always had a different color description; Black is multidimensional and cloudy like my darkest thoughts. Blue is transparent like a glass sky. Green is wet like grass underneath the water. My story began when someone told me I sketched human hair 'in a very graphic way' and made me realize a graphic designer was hidden in me. When I grew up, studying graphic design wasn't an option, so I ended up getting a master's degree in TESOL— not my best decision, but it ended up working in my favor later on in my journey.</p>
        <p>I've heard people saying, "it takes wars to go after one's passion," and never thought it would be pretty literal in my case. When the war started in Syria, I had to leave my home country and immigrate to Canada. Landing in Ottawa, I looked at the bright side of it and thought to myself: this is my clue, I can study graphic design— thanks to the master's degree that spared me the language barrier!</p>
        <p>Here at Algonquin College, I was taught by top professors who helped refine my skills and develop my talent. I have learned so much and will continue learning, but I am excited to show you what I've been up to so far.</p>

      <p class="about-text">Hello, I'm Inas— I probably should write it the way I pronounce it— 'Ines.'</p>
      <p class="about-text">I am a Graphic Design Student at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada.<br>I am skilled in the Adobe Creative Suite, including After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I have a humble knowledge of coding in HTML and CSS— I'm grateful for this knowledge as I could code this website! This portfolio includes glimpses of my work so far.</p>
      <p class="about-text">I try hard, I actively chase learning opportunities, and I may not know it all, but nothing can stop me from asking Google!</p>

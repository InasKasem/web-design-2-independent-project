        <p>My story began when I sketched human hair in a graphic way, and realized a little graphic designer was hidden in me. When I grew up, graphic design wasn't an option, so I ended up getting a master's degree in TESOL— very weird, I know! This ended up working in my favor through my journey.</p>
        <p> I've heared people saying "it takes wars to go after one's passion" and never thought it would be pretty literal in my case. When the war started in Syria, I had to leave my home country and immigrate to Canada. Landed in Ottawa, I looked at the bright side of it and thought to myself: this is my clue, I can study graphic design, and I won't have to learn the language— thanks to the master's degree that I thought I'll never appreciate!</p>
        <p>Here at Algonquin College, I was taught by top professors who helped refine my skills and develop my talent. I'm excited to show you what I've learned so far.</p>

      <p class="about-text">Hello, I’m Inas— I propably should write it the way I pronounce it— 'Ines'. I am a Graphic Design Student at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. I am skilled in the Adobe Creative Suite, including After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and I have a humble knowledge of coding in HTML and CSS— I'm grateful to this knowledge as I was able to code this website! This portfolio includes glimpses of my work so far.</p>
      <p class="about-text">I try hard, I actively chase learning oportunities, and I may not know it all— just yet, but nothing stops me from asking Google!</p>
